# rust-new-project-template
Here is a mini command line tool proejct in Rust to check if two file contents are same. The idea for the command line tool weekly is to implement a diffchecker with function to: output different line number, if two files are same, or even show that in UI

## Usage
-- check --file1 "file.txt" "file1.txt"
output will be true or false
